# VoluScan
VoluScan is an open-source web-based API designed to calculate the volume of scanned 3D mesh objects, such as masks or medical devices. This project provides an API that allows users to upload 3D meshes, which are then processed to calculate their volume. Additionally, the front-end utilizes WebGPU for real-time visualization and Three.js for rendering 3D meshes in the browser.
